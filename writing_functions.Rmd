```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6, 
  fig.asp = .6, 
  out.width = "90%"
)
theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
options(
  ggplot.continuous.colour = "viridis", 
  ggplot.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)
scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```

## Do something simple

```{r}
x_vec = rnorm(30, mean = 5, sd = 3)
## vector that is normal, 30 values, mean 5, sd 3

(x_vec - mean(x_vec)) / sd(x_vec)
## gives you z scores that you can look at and scan for sd 
```

I want a function to compute z-scores 

```{r}
z_scores = function(x) {
  
  if (!is.numeric(x)){
    stop("Input must be numeric")
  }
  
  if (length(x)  < 3) {
    stop("Input must have at least 3 numbers")
  }
  
  z = (x - mean(x) / sd(x))
  
  return(z)
}

z_scores(x_vec)
```

Try my fucntion on some other things --- these should give errors... 

```{r, error=TRUE}
z_scores(3)
## doesnt work because sd will not return 

z_scores("my name is kailey")
## cannot take mean of character 

z_scores(mtcars)
## cant take the mean of a dataset 

z_scores(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
## works becasue it turns logical into a sequence of 0 and 1s (coercion)

## in each of these, the function does something wrong
```

update the function (done in the function step above with adding if statements)
